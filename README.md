Useful for performing quick reboots or for pulling statistics from the Home Hub.

## Usage

Download one of the [releases](https://github.com/jamesnetherton/homehub-cli/releases) for your operating system.

For *nix and OS X:

    ./homehub-cli

For Windows:

    homehub-cli.exe

You'll need to authenticate against the Home Hub in order to do anything useful. Use the `Login` command to do this. Pressing the `TAB` key shows all of the available commands.

## Building

    git clone git@github.com:jamesnetherton/homehub-cli.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/jamesnetherton/homehub-cli
    make build

Generated binaries are output to the `build` directory.
